Participants in the waiting room are represented by `DyteWaitlistedParticipant` objects. If the local user has the permission to 
accept waiting room requests (`selfPermissions.host.canAcceptRequests` is true), you can manage pending waiting room requests, 
accepting or rejecting them as needed.
You can access the list of waitlisted participants via the `meeting.participants.waitlisted` property. 

**Note**: If the local user is not a host, `meeting.participants.waitlisted` property returns an empty list.

### Accepting Requests

To accept a waiting room request, use the acceptWaitListedRequest() method on a `DyteWaitlistedParticipant` object:

```kotlin
val waitlistedParticipant = meeting.participants.waitlisted[0]
waitlistedParticipant.acceptWaitListedRequest()
```

### Rejecting Requests

To deny a waiting room request, use the `rejectWaitListedRequest()` method on a `DyteWaitlistedParticipant` object:

```kotlin
val waitlistedParticipant = meeting.participants.waitlisted[0]
waitlistedParticipant.rejectWaitListedRequest()
```

### Waiting Room Events

Implement the `DyteWaitlistEventsListener` interface to listen for events related to the waiting room:

```kotlin
meeting.addWaitlistEventsListener(object: DyteWaitlistEventsListener {
    override fun onWaitListParticipantJoined(participant: DyteWaitlistedParticipant) {
        // Triggered when a new participant joins the waiting room
    }

    override fun onWaitListParticipantAccepted(participant: DyteWaitlistedParticipant) {
        // Triggered when a waitlisted participant is accepted into the meeting
    }

    override fun onWaitListParticipantRejected(participant: DyteWaitlistedParticipant) {
        // Triggered when a waitlisted participant is denied entry into the meeting
    }

    override fun onWaitListParticipantClosed(participant: DyteWaitlistedParticipant) {
        // Triggered when a waitlisted participant leaves the waiting room
    }
})
```
