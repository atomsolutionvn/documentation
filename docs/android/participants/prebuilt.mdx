# Manage Participants

This section explains how to list and manage participants in your Dyte app.

## Listing Participants

To show the list of participants in your app, you can use the `DyteParticipantsFragment` class.

You can create an instance of this class and call the show method to display the list of current participants as shown below:

```kotlin
val dyteParticipantsFragment = DyteParticipantsFragment()
dyteParticipantsFragment.show(
  fragmentManager,
  "SOME_TAG_HERE"
)
```

It should show something like below, with the list of participants in the room:

<img
  src="/static/android-ui-kit/participants-list.png"
  style={{ width: 400 }}
/>

## Host Controls

If you are the host of the room, you will see the **host controls** when you click the **three-dot menu** on the top right corner of the participants list. The host controls allow you to manage the participants in the room.

The host controls include the following options:

- **Mute/Unmute**: Mute or unmute a participant.
- **Kick**: Kick a participant from the room.
- **Pin**: Pin a participant's video.
- **Turn off video**: Turn off a participant's video.

<img src="/static/android-ui-kit/host-controls.png" style={{ width: 400 }} />
<br />

You can also use these methods from our participant object to
perform these actions programmatically.

```kotlin
val participant = meeting.participants.joined.firstOrNull { it.id == participantId }

participant?.let { pcpt ->
  // To disable a participant's video stream
  pcpt.disableVideo();

  // To disable a participant's audio stream
  pcpt.disableAudio();

  // To kick a participant from the meeting
  pcpt.kick();
}
```

You can also `pin` or `unpin` a participant in the meeting. All "pinned"
participants are added to the `meeting.participants.pinned` map.

```kotlin
val participant = meeting.participants.joined.firstOrNull { it.id == participantId }

participant?.let { pcpt ->
  // To pin a participant
  pcpt.pin();

  // To unpin a participant
  pcpt.unpin();
}
```
