Dyte provides a default pre-call preview UI, also known as setup screen as part of our UI components.

To use the default pre-built setup screen you can use `DyteSetupFragment` from our components.

```kotlin
fragmentManager
  .beginTransaction()
  .add(id.fragmentContainer, DyteSetupFragment(), "TAG")
  .commit()
```

If you want to break down the above for a custom UI but still want to reuse the default setup screen, use the following component.

If you want to build a custom pre-call UI, let's go to the next page to start building one.
