# Introducing chat

The meeting chat object is stored in `meeting.chat`, which has methods for sending and receiving messages. There are 3 types of messages that can be sent in chat - text messages, images, and files.

The `meeting.chat.messages` array contains all the messages that have been sent
in the chat. This is an array of objects, where each object is of type
`DyteChatMessage`.

We support three types of chat messages, they are as follows

- Text Message

```swift
class DyteTextMessage {
  let userId: String
  let displayName: String
  let read: Bool
  let pluginId: String?
  let message: String
  let time: String
  let channelId: String? = null
}
```

- Image Message

```swift
class DyteImageMessage{
  let userId: String
  let displayName: String
  let read: Bool
  let pluginId: String?
  let link: String
  let time: String
  let channelId: String? = null
}
```

- File Message

```swift
class DyteFileMessage{
  let userId: String
  let displayName: String
  let read: Bool
  let pluginId: String?
  let name: String
  let time: String
  let link: String
  let size: Int64
  let channelId: String? = null
}
```

All above objects are of type `DyteChatMessage` along with their own class
variables.
