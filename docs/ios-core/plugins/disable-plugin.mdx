# Functions to disable plugins

Each plugin in `meeting.plugins` object is of type
[`DytePlugin`](./introduction) and exposes the following functions to disable
plugins.

### Deactivate Plugin

The `deactivate()` method deactivates the plugin for all users in the meeting. When you deactivate a plugin, it moves out of the active plugins list and can only be accessed from `meeting.plugins.all`.

```swift
let plugin = meeting.plugins.active[0]

plugin.deactivate()
```
