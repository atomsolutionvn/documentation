- Livestreaming is often used for events, such as concerts, conferences, and sports games, as well as for online classes, gaming, and social media platforms.
- Dyte uses LHLS to deliver low latency one way streams
- The Interactive Livestream product delivers interactivity via chat, polls, reactions etc
- Viewer can also be pulled in the livestream by the host using Stage Management APIs

This topic talks about how you can use livestreaming properties, events, and functions.

`DyteLivestream` object obtained by `meeting.livestream` method. The objects and methods it contains are defined below.

## Objects

### roomName [*String*]

The name of the room.<br />

### state [*LiveStreamState*]

The current status of the livestream, possible values can be: <br/>

- `LiveStreamState.NONE`
- `LiveStreamState.STARTING`
- `LiveStreamState.STARTED`
- `LiveStreamState.STOPPING`
- `LiveStreamState.STOPPED`
- `LiveStreamState.ERRORED`

### stage requests [*_List&ltDyteLiveStreamStageRequestPeer&gt_*]

object accessed via `meeting.livestream.stageRequestPeers` contains the list of requests to join the stage. Each request contains 3 properties:<br />

1. `peerId`: [*String*] The peerId of the user who requested to join the stage.
2. `userId`: [*String*] The userId of the user who requested to join the stage.
3. `displayName`: [*String*] The display name of the user who requested to join the stage.<br/><br />

### liveStreamUrl [*String*]

List of URL which can be used to consume livestream.

## **Host Controls Methods**

Dyte's stage management APIs allow hosts to receive and manage stage requests as well as leave and join the stage.

### Accept request

This method lets the host accept a request to join the stage. It takes the _DyteLiveStreamStageRequestPeer.id_ as an argument whose request has to be accepted.

```swift
meeting.livestream.acceptRequest(peer: peer.id);
```

### Reject request

This method lets the host reject a request to join the stage. It takes the _DyteLiveStreamStageRequestPeer.id_ as an argument whose request has to be rejected.

```swift
meeting.livestream.rejectRequest(peer: peer.id);
```

### Accept all requests

This method lets the host accept all the requests to join the stage.

```swift
meeting.livestream.acceptAll();
```

### Reject all requests

This method lets the host reject all the requests to join the stage.

```swift
meeting.livestream.rejectAll();
```

You can listen to livestream events by attaching a listener by calling `addLivestreamEventsListener` on `meeting` object where `meeting` is an instance of `DyteMobileClient()`.

```swift
meeting.addLiveStreamEventsListener(liveStreamEventsListener: self)
```

```swift
extension LivestreamViewController: DyteLiveStreamEventsListener {
    public func onJoinRequestAccepted(peer: LiveStreamStagePeer) {
        // when localUser's join request is accepted by host
    }

    public func onJoinRequestRejected(peer: LiveStreamStagePeer) {
        // when localUser's join request is rejected by host
    }

    public func onLiveStreamEnded() {
        // when livestream is ended
    }

    public func onLiveStreamEnding() {
        // when livestream is ending
    }

    public func onLiveStreamErrored() {
        // errored livestream
    }

    public func onLiveStreamStarted() {
        // when livestream is started
    }

    public func onLiveStreamStarting() {
        // when livestream is starting
    }

    public func onLiveStreamStateUpdate(data: DyteLivestreamData) {
        // when there is an update in state of the livestream
    }

    public func onStageCountUpdated(count: Int32) {
        // when stage count updates in livestream
    }

    public func onStageRequestsUpdated(requests: [LiveStreamStageRequestPeer]) {
        // when there are updates in stage requests
    }

    public func onViewerCountUpdated(count: Int32) {
        // when viewer count updates in livestream
    }

}
```
