Participants in the waiting room are represented by `DyteWaitlistedParticipant` objects. If the local user has the permission to
accept waiting room requests (`selfPermissions.host.canAcceptRequests` is true), you can manage pending waiting room requests,
accepting or rejecting them as needed.
You can access the list of waitlisted participants via the `meeting.participants.waitlisted` property.

**Note**: If the local user is not a host, `meeting.participants.waitlisted` property returns an empty list.

### Accepting Requests

To accept a waiting room request, use the acceptWaitListedRequest() method on a `DyteWaitlistedParticipant` object:

```swift
let waitlistedParticipant = meeting.participants.waitlisted[0]
waitlistedParticipant.acceptWaitListedRequest()
```

### Rejecting Requests

To deny a waiting room request, use the `rejectWaitListedRequest()` method on a `DyteWaitlistedParticipant` object:

```swift
let waitlistedParticipant = meeting.participants.waitlisted[0]
waitlistedParticipant.rejectWaitListedRequest()
```

### Waiting Room Events

Implement the `DyteWaitlistEventsListener` interface to listen for events related to the waiting room:

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteWaitlistEventsListener {

  func onWaitListParticipantJoined(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      // triggered when waitList peer is joined
  }

  func onWaitListParticipantAccepted(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      // triggered when waitListed peer is accepted by host
  }

  func onWaitListParticipantRejected(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      // triggered when entry of waitListed peer declined by host
  }

  func onWaitListParticipantClosed(participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      // triggered when waitListed peer get's disconnected
  }
}
```
