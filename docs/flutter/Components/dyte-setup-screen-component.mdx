# DyteSetupScreen

A widget that provides a well-built setup screen using our exportable components itself. This widget integrates with the Dyte UI Kit and gives our setup page as a widget.

[`DyteProvider`](./dyte-provider.mdx) needs to be added above `DyteSetupScreen` which will manage dyte client object for polls screen by itself.

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the `DyteSetupScreen` in your Flutter app:

```dart
DyteSetupScreen(
