1. **PSTN** 🔵 : Can integrate with third-party SIP to provide telephony support.

2. **Callkit (iOS)** 🟠 : Customers can add it at their end, sample code is available.

3. **Data center selection** ⭐ : With Twilio a Room can only take place in one Data Center at a time, so that means if a user from the US is connecting with a user in India, a region in the middle of two (like Europe) would be choose by default under 'gcc'. In Dyte a single media meeting can take place across multiple regions (Beta), so for the previous example the US user will connect to the US region and the Indian user to the India region.

**Note:** These are upper bound numbers and it might not be possible to reach the maximum of multiple of these metrics at the same time. For example, in a scenario where participants in Room (Meeting) = 10000; we will not be able to do 300 publications per Room with 30 subscriptions per Participant.

Reach out to us at support [at] dyte.io to understand how we can accommodate your limits.
