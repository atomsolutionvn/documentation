      <p>
        It is important to understand that you need to create participants with
        two kinds of presets for livestreaming. One preset is used for the
        livestreaming <b>host</b> and the other preset is used for the
        livestreaming <b>viewer</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The host requires certain host controls such as the ability to Kick
        Participants, Mute Audio, Mute Video, and Pin Participant, as well as
        media permissions like Start Livestream and Admit or remove participants
        from the livestream. Ensure that you've selected those permissions for
        the host.
