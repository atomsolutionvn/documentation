Dyte records the audio and video of multiple users in a meeting, as well as
interactions with Dyte plugins, in a single file using composite recording mode.

## How does Dyte recording work?

Dyte recordings are powered by anonymous virtual bot users who join your
meeting, record it, and then upload it to Dyte's AWS S3 bucket. For video files,
we currently support the
[H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding) and
[VP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8) codecs.

1. When the recording is finished, it is stored in Dyte's AWS S3 bucket.
2. Dyte generates a downloadable link from which the recording can be
   downloaded. You can get the download URL using the
   [Fetch details of a recording API](/api?v=v2#/operations/get_one_recording)
   or from the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/).

   You can receive notifications of recording status in any of the following
   ways:

   - Using the
     [`recording.statusUpdate`](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events#recordingstatusupdate)
     webhook. Dyte uses webhooks to notify your application when an event
     happens.
   - Using the
     [Fetch active recording API](/api?v=v2#/operations/get_active_recording).
   - You can also view the states of recording from the
     [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/).

3. Download the recording from the download url and store it to your cloud
   storage. The file is kept on Dyte's server for seven days before being
   deleted.

   You can get the download URL using the
   [Fetch active recording API](/api?v=v2#/operations/get_active_recording). or
   from the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/).

   We support transferring recordings to AWS, Azure, and DigitalOcean storage
   buckets. You can also choose to preconfigure the storage configurations using
   the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/) or the
   [Start recording a meeting API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording).

## Workflow

A typical workflow for recording a meeting involves the following steps:

1. Start a recording using the
   [POST endpoint](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) or client side SDK / UI.
2. Stop the recording using the
   [PUT endpoint](/api/?v=v2#/operations/stop_recording) or client side SDK / UI..
3. Fetch the download URL for downloading the recording using the
   [GET endpoint](/api/?v=v2#/operations/get_one_recording), webhook or from the
   Developer Portal.
